Using an API to populate a page with gifs!

Buttons are preloaded that the user can click on to display popular gifs. The user may also 
add buttons to the page that do the same thing. Clicking on the still images will start the animation. 
The user can click to save a favorite gif for the session and view them in the favorites section. 

Example of fully utilizing API calls and JSON to get information and images on the page. 

I utilized data and appended it to not only images, but the buttons for the favorite list,
so dynamically created aspects would have the information I needed later. 

Overall this was an excellent exercise in jQuery
