Using an API to populate a page with gifs!

Example of fully utilizing API calls and JSON to get information and images on the page. 

Challenges were sorting through the data given back by the API for the information I wanted,
including the still and moving images. 

I utilized data and appended it to not only images, but the buttons for the favoirite list,
so dynamically created aspects would have the information I needed later. 

Overall this was an excellent exercise in jQuery.
